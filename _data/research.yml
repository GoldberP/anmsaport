- title: Miniaturised Optofluidic Platforms for Point-of-Care Diagnostics
  image: /img/research/jj_ecliak.jpg
  description: "A paradigm shift from bulky and expensive diagnostics to rapid real-time chemical and biological detection 
  is offered by micro-engineering technology with enhanced functions and performance combining sample preparation, 
  manipulation and delivery. Medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, homeland security and forensics increasingly 
  demand specific and field-deployable analytical technologies for quick point-of-care diagnostics. Enhancement via localized
  optical fields on nanoscale metallic materials generates huge signals in SERS, enabling single molecule detection. 
  This enhancement can be tuned by manipulation of the surface roughness and architecture at the sub-micron level. 
  Simultaneous identification of different molecules in a mixture is among the distinct advantages of SERS over other 
  spectroscopic techniques. This project is focussed on development of reproducible, well-defined and stable surfaces for 
  SERS detection in a microfluidic device. These are reliably produced, tested and integrated into a fluidic chip with optical 
  fibre based SERS detection. Here we combine high sensitivity offered by SERS surfaces produced by optimised 
  electrohydrodynamic lithography to deliver a completely portable miniaturised SERS-based system for point-of-care 
  diagnostics."

- title: Understanding Drivers of Adhesion of Hydrophobic Actives onto Skin Mimics
  image: /img/research/george_keurgm.png
  description: "Most skin care products nowadays contain active moisturizing agents that moisturize the skin leaving it with 
  a healthy and smooth appearance. This project is co-funded with P\u0026G and aims to study the retention processes on the 
  human skin after the application of such products to better understand the underlying mechanisms and the way we can change 
  parameters in the formulation of skin care products in order to improve their effectiveness. The representative formulations 
  include body wash products and the moisturizing agent is petrolatum, which has been proved to be the most effective 
  moisturizing element, including its occlusive properties that diminish trans-epidermal water loss and its protective 
  capabilities to the skin from wind and dryness. In this project we are recreating shower conditions in a controlled, 
  laboratory environment, where we can test the products on novel optimised skin mimics and then study those for the retention 
  of actives. This study also required the production of dedicated representative emulsions and a water jet set-up specifically 
  esigned and used to remove the emulsion from the skin mimics."

  description: "A DSTL funded project focusing on synthesizing novel 3D-nanomaterial structures utilizing a synthetic biology 
  approach to develop surfaces capable of optical and photonic characteristics. Synthetic biology mimics processes seen in 
  nature and exploiting them to yield real world applications of ‘smart materials’. One of the main areas of focus is on the 
  development of a paper-based bio-detector for rapid colorimetric detection of heavy metals, such as Hg2+ and Pb2+ that can 
  be visualized with the naked-eye."

- title: Fabrication of Novel Nanostructures from Viral Building Blocks
  image: /img/research/Picture1_vqitst.png
  description: "Human progress has been punctuated by the development of new materials that have revolutionised the way 
  we live. The transition from bronze to iron ages catalysed a sea change in agriculture while the advent of silicon 
  semiconductors brought on the new information age. In this project we aim to explore a whole range of new materials 
  produceControlling Collagen Formation in Wounds Using Smart Dressingsd by combining the exquisite morphological conformaty offered by biological materials (in this case bacteriophage) 
  with advances in material sciences. The aim of this combination of disciplines (a core part of Synthetic Biology) is to 
  generate new optoelectronic materials that will provide opportunities across the defence sector. Nanostructures with 
  periodicities that are comparable to the light wavelength, i.e., photonic band-gap (PBG) and meta-materials, can trap 
  certain colours enabling control of light to achieve amazing optical effects that are impossible with conventional optics.
  One of the main obstacles to realize these concepts is the enormous difficulty to fabricate periodic three-dimensional (3D) 
  nanostructures. This project makes use of viruses to construct such 3D nano-architectures. Viral fragments are used similar 
  LEGO bricks, which correctly fit together in one unique way. The viral blocks are designed to build-up well-defined 
  assembled 3D-periodic network nanoscale structures which exhibit unique optical properties. These new developments of 
  tailorable platforms realizes the concept of changing the shape and spacing of internal structures within novel 
  biosynthetically generated  metamaterials, opening the door to transforming light in many ways producing tailorable, 
  low-observable devices and materials that could be applied to large surface areas."

- title: Point of Care Diagnostics for Traumatic Brain Injury
  image: /img/research/carl_xqbtjg.png
  description: "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with neuro-disabilities 
  requiring long-term care. Timely TBI-diagnosis is at the heart of national guidelines, however, this is poorly supported by 
  urrent technologies which fall short of the PoC diagnostic needs [1]. This project aims to enable an approach based on 
  Raman spectroscopy of the back of the eye, capable of detecting changes in CSF without the need for a lumbar puncture or 
  expensive radiological scans. It is envisioned that Raman spectroscopy of the optic nerve could be used to observe subtle 
  chemical changes as a result of TBI that are otherwise undetectable in the peripheral circulation [2, 3]."

- title: Controlling Collagen Formation in Wounds Using Smart Dressings
  image: /img/research/emma_s5ap5n.jpg
  description: "Collagen networks determine the functional properties of most connective tissue. Through self-assembly 
  of procollagen, followed by covalent cross-links, a network of fibres is established in a hierarchical fashion, across 
  molecular and macro-scales. Characteristic features of this network influences cell growth and therefore tissue function. 
  [1] For example, the 15nm spacing of the collagen lattice within the cornea causes scattered light to interfere 
  destructively resulting in its transparency. [2] Scarring within tissue is the result of a disrupted collagen matrix, 
  with the tissue only ever returning to 70% strength, inducing discomfort and even blindness for a patient. [3] Collagen 
  self-assembly is both a physical and chemical process. Therefore, identification of methods to manipulate the formation of 
  collagen fibrils in a controlled manner will contribute towards the development of a new generation of dressings for 
  traumatic soft tissue injury patients. Manipulation can be undertaken through changes in topographical surface structure, 
  the introduction of inorganic ions and the presence of an electric field. Through matrix manipulation the development of 
  life altering scarring can be reduced."
