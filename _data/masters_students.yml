  In 2018 he began a year-long industrial placement as a Process Engineer with Solvay S.A.. William returned to the University 
  of Birmingham to complete the last year of his undergraduate Masters study in 2019. His final year Research Project, within 
  Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group, involves producing liposomes to assist in identifying lipid changes in the brain after Traumatic
  Brain Injury through the use of Raman Spectroscopy."

  description: "Max is currently in his third year of study of Chemical Engineering (MEng), however he is keen to explore
  the Biomedical applications of the course, with particular interest in the field of Neuroscience and Neurorehabilitation. 
  This stems from work experience gained in a Neurosurgery department during the year prior to starting his Undergraduate 
  degree, where he was fortunate to interact with patients and observe a number of operations. He hopes to complete his 
  Masters degree over the course of the next year with the scope of starting a PhD afterwards."

  description: "Jasmine Sarwar started her academic career in 2012, graduating with a BSc in Physics from the University 
  of Salford in 2015. From there, she worked as an LED analyst at a cadmium free quantum dot development company designing 
  and testing novel lighting systems until early 2017. In 2017, she undertook a new role as a medical imaging analyst working 
  within clinical trials to quantitatively analyse MRI and CT images whilst also developing new methods of analysis and new 
  protocols. She then gained a Prince2 practitioners qualification in early 2018 where she took on the lead project management
  role of the imaging analysis in a large clinical trial. In October 2018, she then joined the University of Birmingham’s 
  Physical sciences for health PhD programme which lead to a mini project with the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer working 
  on a project titled ‘Towards Targeted Detection and Analysis of Matrix Vesicles (MVS) as Biomarkers of Ageing and Disease’."

  description: "Guy graduated from the University of Birmingham, in 2018 with a Bachelors in Physics. Over the summer of 2018, 
  he completed an internship at University College London, where he segmented kidneys from MRI data, which were then 3D printed
  using a novel gel-wax composite. These 3D printed phantoms were then used for photoacoustic imaging. He then started the
  Physical Sciences for Health integrated MSc/PhD programme in September that year, completing his first of two mini projects
  in the field of fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) for imaging mTBI (mild traumatic brain injury). His second mini 
  project, 'Intracranial monitoring of severe traumatic brain injury via Raman Spectroscopy' sees him working in the ANMSA group,
  using a commercial Renishaw Raman Spectroscopy device, to investigate lipids seen in sTBI (severe traumatic brain injury), as
  well as the development of a portable probe capable of performing raman spectroscopy. Guy aims to start his PhD in October 2019,
  in the field of medical imaging."
