  description: "Max is currently in his third year of study of Chemical Engineering (MEng), however he is keen to explore
  the Biomedical applications of the course, with particular interest in the field of Neuroscience and Neurorehabilitation. 
  This stems from work experience gained in a Neurosurgery department during the year prior to starting his Undergraduate 
  degree, where he was fortunate to interact with patients and observe a number of operations. He hopes to complete his 
  Masters degree over the course of the next year with the scope of starting a PhD afterwards."

  of Salford in 2015. From there, she worked as an LED analyst at a cadmium free quantum dot development company designing 
  and testing novel lighting systems until early 2017. In 2017, she undertook a new role as a medical imaging analyst working 
  within clinical trials to quantitatively analyse MRI and CT images whilst also developing new methods of analysis and new 
  protocols. She then gained a Prince2 practitioners qualification in early 2018 where she took on the lead project management
  role of the imaging analysis in a large clinical trial. In October 2018, she then joined the University of Birmingham’s 
  Physical sciences for health PhD programme which lead to a mini project with the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer working 
  on a project titled ‘Towards Targeted Detection and Analysis of Matrix Vesicles (MVS) as Biomarkers of Ageing and Disease’."
