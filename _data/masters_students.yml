  year long work placement within the Research & Development department at CalGavin Ltd, subsequently returning to Birmingham 
  in September 2021 to complete the final year of his degree. With a particular interest in healthcare technologies, Mark is 
  working on his masters research project within Professor Goldberg Oppenheimerâ€™s group to investigate how CFD can be used to 
  optimise the performance of a novel lab-on-a-chip device designed for the detection of extracellular vesicles as a biomarker 
  for ageing."

  In 2018 he began a year-long industrial placement as a Process Engineer with Solvay S.A.. William returned to the University 
  of Birmingham to complete the last year of his undergraduate Masters study in 2019. His final year Research Project, within 
  Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group, involves producing liposomes to assist in identifying lipid changes in the brain after Traumatic
  Brain Injury through the use of Raman Spectroscopy."

  She is currently in the process of completing her Masters Research Project within Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group. This project is looking at
  characterising saliva using Raman Spectroscopy to diagnose Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Her research is predominantly looking at how processing
  methods, such as freezing and thawing, impact saliva composition."
