  description: "Max is currently in his third year of study of Chemical Engineering (MEng), however he is keen to explore
  the Biomedical applications of the course, with particular interest in the field of Neuroscience and Neurorehabilitation. 
  This stems from work experience gained in a Neurosurgery department during the year prior to starting his Undergraduate 
  degree, where he was fortunate to interact with patients and observe a number of operations. He hopes to complete his 
  Masters degree over the course of the next year with the scope of starting a PhD afterwards."
