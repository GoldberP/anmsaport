  In 2018 he began a year-long industrial placement as a Process Engineer with Solvay S.A.. William returned to the University 
  of Birmingham to complete the last year of his undergraduate Masters study in 2019. His final year Research Project, within 
  Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group, involves producing liposomes to assist in identifying lipid changes in the brain after Traumatic
  Brain Injury through the use of Raman Spectroscopy."

  a year long industrial placement within Research & Development at Jacobs Douwe Egberts before returning to her final year of study in 2019. 
  She is currently in the process of completing her Masters Research Project within Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group. This project is looking at
  characterising saliva using Raman Spectroscopy to diagnose Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Her research is predominantly looking at how processing
  methods, such as freezing and thawing, impact saliva composition."
