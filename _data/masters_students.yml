  description: "Oscar is a chemical engineering masters (MEng) student at the University of Birmingham. On his year in industry (2020-21)
  he worked as a research intern for Ceres Power, where he specialised in hydrogen fuel cell development. In particular the analysis of
  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy where he designed and developed a data analysis app using Matlab. His industrial placement has
  sparked an interest in the development of innovative technology especially in the renewable energy sector. Recently, he has joined 
  Prof. Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group for his research project where he aims to use CFD to optimise a novel lab-on-a-chip device for 
  the detection of extra cellular vesicles as an indicator for ageing."

  year long work placement within the Research & Development department at CalGavin Ltd, subsequently returning to Birmingham 
  in September 2021 to complete the final year of his degree. With a particular interest in healthcare technologies, Mark is 
  working on his masters research project within Professor Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group to investigate how CFD can be used to 
  optimise the performance of a novel lab-on-a-chip device designed for the detection of extracellular vesicles as a biomarker 
  for ageing."

  In 2018 he began a year-long industrial placement as a Process Engineer with Solvay S.A.. William returned to the University 
  of Birmingham to complete the last year of his undergraduate Masters study in 2019. His final year Research Project, within 
  Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer's group, involves producing liposomes to assist in identifying lipid changes in the brain after Traumatic
  Brain Injury through the use of Raman Spectroscopy."
