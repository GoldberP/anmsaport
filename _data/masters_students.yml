  description: "Ana is currently in her final year of MEng Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham. During 
  her undergraduate years, she developed an interest for medical science and formulation engineering. She engaged in the 
  extensive self-study of polytherapy, with particular emphasis on tropical medication and the synergetic effects of combining 
  several active substances, with the intention to pursue a career in the field of drug development. Subsequently, she completed 
  an internship at the ionizing radiation hygiene laboratory, which is part of the department of public health, where she spent 
  her time investigating the radiological quality of drinking water. In 2017 she joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer 
  and stated working on her current research project, which is focused on characterising the retention of hydrophobic actives 
  from cosmetic emulsions on optimized human skin mimics."

  description: "Marina is currently finishing her fourth year of the MEng Chemical and Energy Engineering course at the 
  University of Birmingham. As an undergraduate she focused on two major engineering branches: biomedical engineering and 
  food processing engineering. She studied combination therapy with the aim of theoretically developing a potential daily 
  liquid therapy with powder actives ingredients for children in developing countries. Moreover, she completed her third 
  year design project on the industrial production of butter, which sparked her curiosity towards the food processing 
  industry. She also completed a theoretical investigation on tissue engineering regarding the growth of keratinocyte and 
  fibroblast cells within an automated bioreactor to culture engineered human skin. In 2017 she joined the group of Dr 
  Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham as part of her final year research project, which studies the 
  characterisation of retention of hydrophobic actives from cosmetic emulsions on optimised human skin mimics. In the following 
  academic years, she hopes to accomplish a ME in Biosystems & Food Engineering at University College Dublin."

  currently the Fourth-year representative for the Birmingham University of Chemical Engineering Society (BUCES). In 2016, 
  Max did a summer placement abroad in Malaysia at the company of ‘Azonic Motion & Engineering’, where he worked as a sales 
  engineer. Along with his studies, he every so often works for the company ‘SearchNeasy’ as a creative & development 
  assistant to develop CRM (Customer Relation Management) and ERP (enterprise resource planning) for small developing 
  business. Having studied chemical Engineering, Max has developed the interest in biochemical engineering where he is hoping 
  to pursue a career in the food processing industry. In 2017, Max has joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer as part of 
  his research project. His research project involves synthesising a novel viral nanostructure from M13 for optical and sensing 
  applications."

  hazard review discussions with operators and manufacturing engineers to ensure safe operations. He had also completed a 
  summer internship for Searchneasy where he developed a complete web based ERP (Enterprise resource planning) business 
  management system for start-up business that offers flexible, customable and affordable solutions. He collaborated with 
  skilled software engineers to provide an easy CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for small developing business 
  that takes care of customer’s management issues. In addition he completed his third year design project on the industrial 
  production of crumpets and teacakes which lead his interest towards the food processing industry. In 2017 he joined the 
  group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheier and stated working on his current research project which is focused on the synthesis of 
  novel viral nano-structures with M13 bacteriophage for sensing and optical applications."

  description: "Max is currently in his third year of study of Chemical Engineering (MEng), however he is keen to explore
  the Biomedical applications of the course, with particular interest in the field of Neuroscience and Neurorehabilitation. 
  This stems from work experience gained in a Neurosurgery department during the year prior to starting his Undergraduate 
  degree, where he was fortunate to interact with patients and observe a number of operations. He hopes to complete his 
  Masters degree over the course of the next year with the scope of starting a PhD afterwards."
