  description: "Oscar is a chemical engineering masters (MEng) student at the University of Birmingham. On his year in industry (2020-21)
  he worked as a research intern for Ceres Power, where he specialised in hydrogen fuel cell development. In particular the analysis of
  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy where he designed and developed a data analysis app using Matlab. His industrial placement has
  sparked an interest in the development of innovative technology especially in the renewable energy sector. Recently, he has joined 
  Prof. Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group for his research project where he aims to use CFD to optimise a novel lab-on-a-chip device for 
  the detection of extra cellular vesicles as an indicator for ageing."

  invaluable work experience through completing various roles in research and development including a summer internship role in 
  hydrophobic coatings manufacture at GCP Applied Technologies (2018) and a yearlong industrial placement in the chocolate research 
  & development department at Mondelēz International (2019-2020) where she developed a knowledge of commercial scale chocolate 
  personalisation and customisation techniques. She returned to the University of Birmingham to complete her last two years of her 
  undergraduate master's degree. Fareeha is currently working on her final year master’s project within Professor Goldberg Oppenheimer’s
  research group to research the applications of Raman spectroscopy analysis of extracellular vesicles in chronic illness diagnosis, 
  including contributions to the development of Raman spectral libraries of healthy and diseases extracellular vesicles and their subgroups."
