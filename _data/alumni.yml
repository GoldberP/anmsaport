  description: "Dr. Yiwei Sun was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at ANMSA group during 2018 and he is currently a PDRA at Queen
  Marry University of London. He obtained BSc. in Physics at Fudan University, China in 2011 and PhD in Physics at Queen Mary
  University of London, UK in 2015. He then worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Zhejiang University, China before he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University 
  of Birmingham in 2018. Yiwei’s research expertise is on Raman spectroscopy (including advanced analysis on spectra), 
  high pressure techniques (DACs) and ab initio calculations. His research field covers the mechanics of carbon nanotubes, 
  graphene, graphite and other 2D layered materials. His current research focuses on the fabrication and characterisation of 
  graphene-based nanostructures from viral building blocks and the design and setting-up of a portable Raman 3D-priting 
  system."

  She graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2014 with a degree in Material Science with Sport Science before 
  joining the physical sciences for health centre for doctoral training. She joined the group for a masters project where 
  she looked at the use of electro-hydrodynamic lithography to pattern surfaces to force the alignment of collagen fibres. 
  She has since started a PhD developing an in vitro model of osteoarthritis under the supervision of Prof. Liam Grover and 
  Dr. Simon Jones."

  Physics in 2016. His masters project was on nuclear physics and was entitled ‘Next generation detectors for the 
  manipulation of PET isotopes’. In 2016 he started on the EPSRC Physical Sciences for Health programme, and started a 
  mini-project in Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group titled ‘Towards Targeted Detection and Analysis of Matrix Vesicles (MVS) 
  as Biomarkers of Ageing and Disease’."
