  description: "Dr. Yiwei Sun was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at ANMSA group during 2018 and he is currently a PDRA at Queen
  Marry University of London. He obtained BSc. in Physics at Fudan University, China in 2011 and PhD in Physics at Queen Mary
  University of London, UK in 2015. He then worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Zhejiang University, China before he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University 
  of Birmingham in 2018. Yiwei’s research expertise is on Raman spectroscopy (including advanced analysis on spectra), 
  high pressure techniques (DACs) and ab initio calculations. His research field covers the mechanics of carbon nanotubes, 
  graphene, graphite and other 2D layered materials. His current research focuses on the fabrication and characterisation of 
  graphene-based nanostructures from viral building blocks and the design and setting-up of a portable Raman 3D-priting 
  system."

  engaged in the extensive self-study of polytherapy, with particular emphasis on tropical medication and the synergetic effects of combining 
  several active substances, with the intention to pursue a career in the field of drug development. Subsequently, she completed 
  an internship at the ionizing radiation hygiene laboratory, which is part of the department of public health, where she spent 
  her time investigating the radiological quality of drinking water. In 2017 she joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer 
  and stated working on her current research project, which was focused on characterising the retention of hydrophobic actives 
  from cosmetic emulsions on optimized human skin mimics."

  description: "Marina has recently currently finished her fourth year of the MEng Chemical and Energy Engineering course at the 
  University of Birmingham. As an undergraduate she focused on two major engineering branches: biomedical engineering and 
  food processing engineering. She studied combination therapy with the aim of theoretically developing a potential daily 
  liquid therapy with powder actives ingredients for children in developing countries. Moreover, she completed her third 
  year design project on the industrial production of butter, which sparked her curiosity towards the food processing 
  industry. She also completed a theoretical investigation on tissue engineering regarding the growth of keratinocyte and 
  fibroblast cells within an automated bioreactor to culture engineered human skin. In 2017 she joined the group of Dr 
  Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham as part of her final year research project, which studied the 
  characterisation of retention of hydrophobic actives from cosmetic emulsions on optimised human skin mimics. In the following 
  academic years, she hopes to accomplish a ME in Biosystems & Food Engineering at University College Dublin."
