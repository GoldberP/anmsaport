  She graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2014 with a degree in Material Science with Sport Science before 
  joining the physical sciences for health centre for doctoral training. She joined the group for a masters project where 
  she looked at the use of electro-hydrodynamic lithography to pattern surfaces to force the alignment of collagen fibres. 
  She has since started a PhD developing an in vitro model of osteoarthritis under the supervision of Prof. Liam Grover and
