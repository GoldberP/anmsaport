  description: "Jon started his career at the Welding Institute testing bits of North Sea oil rigs to see if they would 
  fall apart in the cold of the North Sea. Then in 1985 he joined the Microstructural Physics group at the Cavendish 
  laboratory in Cambridge. There he worked on all types of electron microscopes, including VG scanning transmission 
  electron microscopes. In 2014 he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham to undertake 
  a PhD course in Chemical Engineering. His research involves using Raman for point of care diagnostics."

  description: "After completing his BSc Physics with Nanotechnology at Swansea University, Liam moved onto a PhD project 
  in the Centre for Nanohealth at Swansea. His PhD was an industrial linked project through the pan-Wales KESS initiative,
  where Liam worked with Siemens Healthineers to carry out characterisation of raw materials utilised in manufacturing 
  commercial immunoassays. Raman spectroscopy was the primary tool of use, with FTIR spectroscopy also used to reinforce 
  observations made. In 2019 he joined Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer to carry out research related to TBI. His interests are in 
  open science and the development of research tools for clinical applications."

  description: "Mike completed his BSc (Physics) and PhD at the School of Maths and Physics, Queen’s University Belfast, 
  before joining Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group in 2020. His studies at Queen’s Centre for Nanostructured Media centred 
  around analysis of substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) via use of a custom-built, open-bench,
  multi-wavelength Raman spectrometer. Interests in SERS include nanopillar architectures and Fano resonances in periodic
  structures. He has collaborated with Airbus Group Innovations (Munich) on the development of a portable SERS sensor as 
  part of ‘Bomb Factory Detection by Networks of Advanced Sensors’ (BONAS) (EU FP7 Grant agreement 261685)."

  description: "Prior to joining Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer’s group, Martin completed his MChem with Professional Experience 
  at the University of Warwick, then moved onto a PhD project with the Institute of Thin Films, Sensors & Imaging at the
  University of the West of Scotland (UWS). At UWS, Martin had studied several different fabrication methods of producing 
  surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, ranging from chemical methods and vacuum deposition. Research interests
  also include optics, material science and thin films, having also worked on mid-infrared materials for sensors during his 
  time at UWS. Current project involves development of SERS surfaces for biomedical and diagnostic applications."
