  alias: "Jon 'JJ' Rickard"
  description: "Jon started his career at the Welding Institute testing bits of North Sea oil rigs to see if they would 
  fall apart in the cold of the North Sea. Then in 1985 he joined the Microstructural Physics group at the Cavendish 
  laboratory in Cambridge. There he worked on all types of electron microscopes, including VG scanning transmission 
  electron microscopes. In 2014 he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham to undertake 
  a PhD course in Chemical Engineering. His research involves using Raman for point of care diagnostics."

  description: "Dr. Yiwei Sun is a Postdoctoral Research Associate. He obtained BSc. in Physics at Fudan University, 
  China in 2011 and PhD in Physics at Queen Mary University of London, UK in 2015. He then worked as a Postdoctoral 
  Research Fellow at Zhejiang University, China before he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University 
  of Birmingham in 2018. Yiweiâ€™s research expertise is on Raman spectroscopy (including advanced analysis on spectra), 
  high pressure techniques (DACs) and ab initio calculations. His research field covers the mechanics of carbon nanotubes, 
  graphene, graphite and other 2D layered materials. His current research focuses on the fabrication and characterisation of 
  graphene-based nanostructures from viral building blocks and the design and setting-up of a portable Raman 3D-priting 
  system."

  description: "Michael graduated from University of Birmingham, in 2012 with a BSc in Physics and Astrophysics. 
  He then went on to join the Physical Sciences of Imaging in the Biomedical Sciences (PSIBS) Doctoral training centre, 
  where he obtain a MSc and PhD. His doctoral research focused on the application and development of near infrared 
  spectroscopy for detecting hypoxia in brain trauma patients. In 2016 he moved to the Medical Physics department at the 
  Queen Elizabeth Hospital, focusing on clinical computing and imaging. He joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer in 
  2018 as a Research Fellow. His interests lie in bridging the gaps between disciplines, to facilitate the translation of 
  imaging techniques from research into clinical use."
