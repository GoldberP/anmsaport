  description: "Georgia graduated from the University of Exeter in 2019 with a BSc in Physics where her interest in biomedical
  physics and cruelty-free research began. In the summer of 2018, she completed an internship at UCL where she developed a desktop
  filament extruder system for 3D printers; aiming to produce filaments formed of recycled failed prints and support material. 
  She also worked on printing a kidney phantom using gel-wax compatible with photoacoustic imaging to aid presurgical planning. 
  She joined the ANMSA group under the LifETIME CDT and will continue previous work in developing a point-of-care device to diagnose
  TBI with the hopes of including elements of tissue engineering and non-animal technologies."

  a research Masters. His thesis investigated the mechanistic outcomes of a critical care trial, ‘Study into the Reversal of Septic Shock with Landiolol (β-blockade)’ (STRESS-L), 
  considered to be the largest randomised multi-centre clinical trial of its kind to date. Based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Jarrod employed several techniques 
  including mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate metabolic variations between the control and interventional groups, in addition to multiplex technology to deduce 
  immune system changes and several ELISAs to infer differences in cardiac stress and function associated with β-blockade in intensive care patients. His research interests are 
  predominantly clinical and healthcare-associated and in 2022 joined Professor Oppenheimer’s research group to work on the detection of cancer, intra-operative cancer margins 
  assessment and variety of other diseases through Raman spectroscopy working in conjunction with consultants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital."
