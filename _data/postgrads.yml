  description: "Georgia graduated from the University of Exeter in 2019 with a BSc in Physics where her interest in biomedical
  physics and cruelty-free research began. In the summer of 2018, she completed an internship at UCL where she developed a desktop
  filament extruder system for 3D printers; aiming to produce filaments formed of recycled failed prints and support material. 
  She also worked on printing a kidney phantom using gel-wax compatible with photoacoustic imaging to aid presurgical planning. 
  She joined the ANMSA group under the LifETIME CDT and will continue previous work in developing a point-of-care device to diagnose
  TBI with the hopes of including elements of tissue engineering and non-animal technologies."

  of placements focusing around the application of nanoparticles as drug delivery vectors. During 2013 I was awarded a Royal 
  Society of Chemistry undergraduate research award for my research into ‘The effects of bio-conjugating nanoparticles with 
  antibiotics to increase anti-bacterial activity’. Following my undergraduate degree, I chose to pursue a PhD in Chemical 
  Engineering at the University of Birmingham within Dr Pola Oppenheimer’s research group to ‘Develop novel nano-metamaterials 
  using synthetic biological building blocks’ utilizing techniques such as nano-lithography, AFM and TEM."

  Biotechnology in 2012. In the same year he enrolled for the two years Master Degree in Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology 
  at the University of L’Aquila. There he spent one year working on his thesis in a laboratory of Molecular Biology where he 
  focused on the development and characterization of a new 3D Graphene-based self-assembled composite material and also 
  showing its reactivity towards some types of metals. In 2016 he joined the group of Dr Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  university of Birmingham as a PhD student in Chemical Engineering working on the development of novel nano-metamaterials 
  from a range of viral building blocks."

  a Year in Computer Science (MSci). He then went on to develop scientific software applications for the oil and gas, 
  pharmaceutical and FMCG industries. He has since worked as a technical lead at a number of start-ups, specialising in cloud 
  servers, non-relational databases and continuous delivery. In 2015 he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  University of Birmingham, working within the EPSRC Physical Sciences for Health Centre. His research explores new methods 
  for point of care diagnostics of traumatic brain injury."

  Physics. Here, she focused on the use of Solid State NMR to look at the interactions of oxygen within catalytic processes. 
  She has also completed a placement at Imanova, where she evaluated a new magnetic resonance technique for the use of 
  locating lesions within the spinal cord on multiple sclerosis patients. In 2015 she began working within the EPSRC Physical 
  Sciences for Health Centre, and through this joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham."
