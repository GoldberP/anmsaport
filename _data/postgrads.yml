  description: "My studies in Chemical Engineering took place in the National and Technical University of Athens. 
  There, working as an undergraduate researcher in the polymer technology lab, I completed my diploma thesis in the field of 
  nanocomposites. The thesis was entitled ”Study of the structure and thermo-mechanical properties of polysiloxane 
  nanocomposites”. The knowledge and experience that I gained during my research, concentrated on the characterization of 
  thermal and mechanical properties of nano-composites. I have also become familiarized with the operating principles and 
  the organology of many basic and very important methods of constructing and characterizing composite nanomaterials including, 
  XRD, SEM, TGA, DSC, hardness and resistance testing etc. Currently I am focusing on the research in the fields of 
  noanomaterials and nanostrcutures."

  of placements focusing around the application of nanoparticles as drug delivery vectors. During 2013 I was awarded a Royal 
  Society of Chemistry undergraduate research award for my research into ‘The effects of bio-conjugating nanoparticles with 
  antibiotics to increase anti-bacterial activity’. Following my undergraduate degree, I chose to pursue a PhD in Chemical 
  Engineering at the University of Birmingham within Dr Pola Oppenheimer’s research group to ‘Develop novel nano-metamaterials 
  using synthetic biological building blocks’ utilizing techniques such as nano-lithography, AFM and TEM."

  at the University of L’Aquila. There he spent one year working on his thesis in a laboratory of Molecular Biology where he 
  focused on the development and characterization of a new 3D Graphene-based self-assembled composite material and also 
  showing its reactivity towards some types of metals. In 2016 he joined the group of Dr Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  university of Birmingham as a PhD student in Chemical Engineering working on the development of novel nano-metamaterials 
  from a range of viral building blocks."
