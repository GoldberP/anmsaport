  description: "Chiara started her studies at the University of Florence in 2005, graduating in 2009 with 
  Bachelor in Chemistry. She then proceeded to a Master in Chemistry, focusing on supramolecular Chemistry, 
  nano-systems and materials, graduating in 2012 with thesis on organic nanostructures for the next generation 
  solar cells. In 2013 Chiara collaborated with Chalmers University of Technology in the field of Applied Physics. 
  In 2014, Chiara has joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham to undertake her 
  PhD course in Chemical Engineering. Her research interests are focused on DNA structured nano-materials, thin films 
  formation, characterisation and patterning using novel and advanced materials for a range of optical and biomedical 
  applications."

  description: "My studies in Chemical Engineering took place in the National and Technical University of Athens. 
  There, working as an undergraduate researcher in the polymer technology lab, I completed my diploma thesis in the field of 
  nanocomposites. The thesis was entitled ”Study of the structure and thermo-mechanical properties of polysiloxane 
  nanocomposites”. The knowledge and experience that I gained during my research, concentrated on the characterization of 
  thermal and mechanical properties of nano-composites. I have also become familiarized with the operating principles and 
  the organology of many basic and very important methods of constructing and characterizing composite nanomaterials including, 
  XRD, SEM, TGA, DSC, hardness and resistance testing etc. Currently I am focusing on the research in the fields of 
  noanomaterials and nanostrcutures."

  of placements focusing around the application of nanoparticles as drug delivery vectors. During 2013 I was awarded a Royal 
  Society of Chemistry undergraduate research award for my research into ‘The effects of bio-conjugating nanoparticles with 
  antibiotics to increase anti-bacterial activity’. Following my undergraduate degree, I chose to pursue a PhD in Chemical 
  Engineering at the University of Birmingham within Dr Pola Oppenheimer’s research group to ‘Develop novel nano-metamaterials 
  using synthetic biological building blocks’ utilizing techniques such as nano-lithography, AFM and TEM."

  at the University of L’Aquila. There he spent one year working on his thesis in a laboratory of Molecular Biology where he 
  focused on the development and characterization of a new 3D Graphene-based self-assembled composite material and also 
  showing its reactivity towards some types of metals. In 2016 he joined the group of Dr Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  university of Birmingham as a PhD student in Chemical Engineering working on the development of novel nano-metamaterials 
  from a range of viral building blocks."

  a Year in Computer Science (MSci). He then went on to develop scientific software applications for the oil and gas, 
  pharmaceutical and FMCG industries. He has since worked as a technical lead at a number of start-ups, specialising in cloud 
  servers, non-relational databases and continuous delivery. In 2015 he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  University of Birmingham, working within the EPSRC Physical Sciences for Health Centre. His research explores new methods 
  for point of care diagnostics of traumatic brain injury."
