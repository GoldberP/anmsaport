  description: "Georgia graduated from the University of Exeter in 2019 with a BSc in Physics where her interest in biomedical
  physics and cruelty-free research began. In the summer of 2018, she completed an internship at UCL where she developed a desktop
  filament extruder system for 3D printers; aiming to produce filaments formed of recycled failed prints and support material. 
  She also worked on printing a kidney phantom using gel-wax compatible with photoacoustic imaging to aid presurgical planning. 
  She joined the ANMSA group under the LifETIME CDT and will continue previous work in developing a point-of-care device to diagnose
  TBI with the hopes of including elements of tissue engineering and non-animal technologies."

  description: "Emma started her academic career in 2011, graduating with a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Science from Robert Gordon
  University in Aberdeen in 2015.  Following her undergraduate degree, Emma went on to obtain an MSc in Analytical Sciences with
  an interest in DNA, proteomics and metabolomics.  Here she carried out research on the development of a DNA biosensor to determine
  the concentration of plasmid DNA involved in bacterial antibiotic resistance.  In 2018, Emma joined the Physical Sciences for Health
  Doctoral training centre, where she obtained a further MSc and has progressed to her first year of PhD as part of Dr Pola Goldberg
  Oppenheimerâ€™s group.  Her research focusses on the development of a novel lab-on-a-chip for the detection of extracellular vesicles 
  as key targets of ageing."

  a Year in Computer Science (MSci). He then went on to develop scientific software applications for the oil and gas, 
  pharmaceutical and FMCG industries. He has since worked as a technical lead at a number of start-ups, specialising in cloud 
  servers, non-relational databases and continuous delivery. In 2015 he joined the group of Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer at the 
  University of Birmingham, working within the EPSRC Physical Sciences for Health Centre. His research explores new methods 
  for point of care diagnostics of traumatic brain injury."

  with a BSc in Physics Engineering in 2014. Followed by one year abroad as Erasmus at the University of Twente (The Netherlands)
  where he completed the first year of the MSc in Applied Physics in Material Science and afterward returned back to Portugal 
  to complete his MSc. He spent one year working on his thesis in INESC Microsistemas e Nanotecnologias where he focused on the 
  development and characterization of monolayered Graphene and its incorporation into EGFET devices finishing the MSc in 2017. 
  In 2018 he joined the group of Dr Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer at the University of Birmingham as a Ph.D. student. His research
  focusses on the optimization of the EHD process, with the use of Raman, towards a point of care diagnostics."

  description: "Mike graduated from the University of the West of England with a degree in Biomedical science in 2014.
  During his time there, he pursued a placement year at the Robert Koch institute in Berlin where he undertook research in Cowpox 
  and other Orthopox viruses. Following his undergraduate degree, he then pursued a Masters by Research in Biological sciences at the 
  University of Warwick where he carried out research on genomic mining in Streptomyces spp. and Streptococcus mutans. After leaving 
  Warwick, Mike worked for Dyson and Public Health England before enrolling in his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of 
  Birmingham. His PhD project is looking at utilising CRISPR and the associated Cas nucleases as well as Raman spectroscopy as rapid 
  point-of-care diagnostic tools for Tuberculosis and its drug-resistant variants."
