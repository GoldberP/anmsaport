                <h5>Pola Goldberg Oppenheimer</h5>
                <p>BSc in Chemistry (Cum-Laude), BEng in Chemical Engineering (Summa Cum Laude), MSc in Chemical Engineering (Cum Laude), PhD in Physics, AMRSC, Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellow.</p>
                <p>Dr Goldberg Oppenheimer holds an academic position at the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham. Her high-impact and trend-setting research focuses on nanostructured surfaces developing sophisticated technologies to realise advanced micro-engineered diagnostic devices. Dr P. Goldberg Oppenheimer holds two B.SC degrees with one in Chemical Engineering (B.Sc., Summa Cum Laude) and one in Chemistry (B.Sc., Cum Laude). Her M.Sc. in Chemical Engineering on composite materials and devices spawned several publications and led to an extensive expertise in suitable characterization and imaging methods including, TEM, cryo-TEM and SEM.</p>
                <p>
                    Dr G. Oppenheimer was then awarded a European Research Kodak scholarship to perform her PhD studies at the Cavendish Laboratories at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Prof. U. Steiner, where she acquired a broad expertise in soft materials particularly, in polymer physics and advanced patterning methods. Her PhD in Physics was awarded the Springer Doctoral Award and was selected to be published in the series of ‘Outstanding Theses’. In recognition of the excellence of Dr Oppenheimer’s research, she has also been the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Carl-Zeiss Award in Engineering at the University of Cambridge (UoC), resulting in extensive media exposure with another accolade for her work was its selection to illustrate the front covers of the Science Magazine and the 2012 Annual Report of the UoC. In 2016, Dr G. Oppenheimer was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowship (as one out of only seven) outstanding, high-quality engineers across the UK developing successful academic research career as a testament to the strong recognised achievements in the field of nano-engineering on a trajectory of becoming exceptional well-recognised international leader.
