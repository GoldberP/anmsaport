        ANMSA focuses on design, engineering and manipulation of novel nanocomposite and hybrid materials and structures on the micron and nanometric scale for a broad range of applications in for instance, microelectronics, diagnostics and photovoltaic cells. The control of patterns on sub-micrometre lateral length scales is of considerable technological interest and is especially relevant for tailoring the properties of novel functional materials. The growing demand for better performance, reduced energy consumption, high-throughput and higher levels of complexity and integration raise the need for alternative technologies capable of more than the generation or reproduction of patterns below the sub-100 nm to develop tunable 3D structures and thus, put these topics among the priorities of our research agenda. We are developing and implementing advanced, cost-effective soft lithography techniques and particularly, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning. We also explore and exploit bottom-up and top-down fabrication strategies to create new classes of high performance structures to mimic the intriguing hierarchical morphologies and patterns found in nature.

        description="Collagen networks determine the functional properties of most connective tissue. Through self-assembly of procollagen, followed by covalent cross-links, a network of fibres is established in a hierarchical fashion, across molecular and macro-scales. Characteristic features of this network influences cell growth and therefore tissue function. [1] For example, the 15nm spacing of the collagen lattice within the cornea causes scattered light to interfere destructively resulting in its transparency. [2] Scarring within tissue is the result of a disrupted collagen matrix, with the tissue only ever returning to 70% strength, inducing discomfort and even blindness for a patient. [3] Collagen self-assembly is both a physical and chemical process. Therefore, identification of methods to manipulate the formation of collagen fibrils in a controlled manner will contribute towards the development of a new generation of dressings for traumatic soft tissue injury patients. Manipulation can be undertaken through changes in topographical surface structure, the introduction of inorganic ions and the presence of an electric field. Through matrix manipulation the development of life altering scarring can be reduced."
