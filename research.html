        ANMSA focuses on design, engineering and manipulation of novel nanocomposite and hybrid materials and structures on the micron and nanometric scale for a broad range of applications in for instance, microelectronics, diagnostics and photovoltaic cells. The control of patterns on sub-micrometre lateral length scales is of considerable technological interest and is especially relevant for tailoring the properties of novel functional materials. The growing demand for better performance, reduced energy consumption, high-throughput and higher levels of complexity and integration raise the need for alternative technologies capable of more than the generation or reproduction of patterns below the sub-100 nm to develop tunable 3D structures and thus, put these topics among the priorities of our research agenda. We are developing and implementing advanced, cost-effective soft lithography techniques and particularly, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning. We also explore and exploit bottom-up and top-down fabrication strategies to create new classes of high performance structures to mimic the intriguing hierarchical morphologies and patterns found in nature.
