            <p>The University is the only UK university to have its own railway station on campus, known as “University Station”.
                The Station is a real asset to the University, making travel by train a convenient option for many. University Station
                is only two stops from Birmingham New Street where staff, students and visitors can catch trains to locations all across the country.
                The journey between the University and Birmingham New Street takes approximately eight minutes. For all timetable information
                visit <a href="www.nationalrail.co.uk">www.nationalrail.co.uk</a></p>
