      We are an interdisciplinary research group at the School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham and are part of the Institute of Translational Medicine (ITM), closely working with the clinical teams at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEHB) and Alta Innovation, the UoB technology transfer specialists.  Our research programme is targeted at exploring the frontiers of micro to nanomaterials engineering while bridging the gap between nano-to-macroscopic-level understanding and implementations of novel hybrid and nanocomposite materials and submicron structures for miniaturised functional devices.
